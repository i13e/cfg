## Requirements

- Git
- Curl

## Install

Install config tracking in your $HOME by running:

    curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i13e/cfg/master/.local/bin/install.sh | /bin/sh

This requires the public key of the machine where the setup is being
installed to be registered as authorized on Github.

### Notes

The install script is currently **unfinished** and will break your system
if you attempt to use it.
